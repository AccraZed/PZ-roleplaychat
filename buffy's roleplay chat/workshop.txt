description=I made this mod for my roleplay server, Necropolis. (tinyurl.com/necroRP)
description=When you type /me, it adds special formatting to your emote. Simple.

description=When you type /name followed by text, it sets your name for the above emote as well as when you /say. 
description=This is to help convey roleplay without having to wonder what xXdarkBuptoXx's character name is. Now it will say it in chat!
