description=An important note is that while I could push fixes, improvements, and changes to this mod near daily, I won't. I know first hand how obnoxious it can be to navigate the hosting side of things, and how updated mods can sometimes make it impossible to enjoy PZ MP with having to constantly reboot because mods update 5 times a day.
description=
description=I'll push an update several days after the last instead if there is one, to give breathing room to everyone and have one less mod to update and worry about. tldr; no daily updates!

description=/levent has been added for admins to narrate localized events without using global chat.
description=Only previously posted messages' usernames will display when using 'Show Usernames'. So, no need to re-open the cog menu and toggle it back; it resets. This is mostly for admins to see real usernames of users for... Adminning.
description=In this example, my steam name is all lowercase 'buffy' and my RP name through /name is 'Buffy'. You can see which is which. :)

description=I made this mod for my roleplay server, Necropolis.
description=When you type /me, it adds special formatting to your emote. Simple.
description=
description=When you type /name followed by text, it sets your name for everything you type in chat.
description=This is to help convey roleplay without having to wonder what xXdarkBuptoXx's character name is. Now it will say it in chat! Project Zomboid has long suffered a lack of roleplay focused mods, and I'm happy to see all of the love and support this one has received. I hope by making this mod open source (attributed) we can continue to keep development in the 'RP' space open and free for everyone to learn and make better.
description=
description=There's many more commands, all listed in the above screenshots.
description=
description=For admins, you can now toggle on/off the OOC/LOOC channels to maintain immersion and prevent spam via the sandbox options. Checked = off, unchecked = on.

description=If you see this mod reuploaded without any changes, in a ModPack, OR posted under a different name without attributing this original page or the buffyuwu/pz-roleplaychat github repository on the mod's steam workshop page, please click the flag icon under the image and report a re-upload. By fragmenting the modding community with unattributed reuploads that lack any link to the original, future PZ modders have an incredibly difficult time finding other 'RP' mod repositories that might have awesome features they could use in their next mod. This mod for example would not have been possible had I not found the code for an old, OLD PZ abandonware chat mod by happenstance. Open source development and crediting where you obtained code from is fantastic practice and what keeps game communities alive, and had I not lucked upon that repository I would never have been inspired to make this mod. :')
